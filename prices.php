				<p class="description">Due to the nature of the business, some sites can take much longer to make a solution to scrape the data.  We will review your request and verify we have correctly identified the data you want and how you want it structured.  Once we do this, that will give us a good idea of how much time and effort it will take us to complete and at that point, we can provide you a quote.  If you want a quote for something a bit more complex than what is stated in the Basic Scrape, <a href="/contact.php">contact us today!</a> We will get back to you in no more than 24 hours.</p>
